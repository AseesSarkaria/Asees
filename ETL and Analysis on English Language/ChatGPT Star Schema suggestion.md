Based on your requirements, here's a proposed star schema for your English language database:

### Fact Table
**Fact_Words**: This table will be the central fact table containing the key information for each word.
- **Word_ID** (Primary Key)
- **Word** 
- **Is_Palindrome** (Boolean)
- **Is_Anagram** (Foreign Key to Word_ID of the anagram, if applicable)
- **Nth_Position_Letter** (Letter in the nth position, if required for specific queries)
- **Word_Length**
- **Source_ID** (Foreign Key to Source_Dim)

### Dimension Tables
1. **Dim_PartOfSpeech**
   - **PartOfSpeech_ID** (Primary Key)
   - **PartOfSpeech_Name** (e.g., noun, verb, adjective)

2. **Dim_Synonyms**
   - **Word_ID** (Foreign Key to Fact_Words)
   - **Synonym_ID** (Foreign Key to Fact_Words)

3. **Dim_Antonyms**
   - **Word_ID** (Foreign Key to Fact_Words)
   - **Antonym_ID** (Foreign Key to Fact_Words)

4. **Dim_Letters**
   - **Letter_ID** (Primary Key)
   - **Letter** (A-Z)

5. **Dim_Origins**
   - **Origin_ID** (Primary Key)
   - **Language_Origin** (e.g., Latin, Greek, Old English)

6. **Dim_WordVariants**
   - **Word_ID** (Foreign Key to Fact_Words)
   - **Variant** (e.g., plural forms, different spellings)

7. **Dim_Usage**
   - **Usage_ID** (Primary Key)
   - **First_Year_Usage**

8. **Dim_FrequencyRank**
   - **FrequencyRank_ID** (Primary Key)
   - **Word_ID** (Foreign Key to Fact_Words)
   - **Frequency_Rank**
   - **Ranking_Source** (Description of the ranking source)

9. **Dim_Sources**
   - **Source_ID** (Primary Key)
   - **Source_Name**
   - **Source_Type** (e.g., dictionary, frequency list)

### Additional Relationships
- **Anagram Relationships**: For storing anagrams, you might want a lookup or associative table that can handle the many-to-many relationship between words.
  
### Key Considerations
- **Normalization**: Dimensions are normalized to reduce redundancy. Fact_Words remains denormalized to optimize query performance.
- **Performance**: Even though performance is not a primary concern, indexing key columns such as Word, PartOfSpeech, and any frequently queried fields will be beneficial.
